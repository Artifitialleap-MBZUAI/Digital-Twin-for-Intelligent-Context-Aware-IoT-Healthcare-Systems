# Digital-Twin-for-Intelligent-Context-Aware-IoT-Healthcare-Systems

This project is the implementation of the experiment proposed in "Digital Twin for Intelligent Context-Aware IoT Healthcare Systems". 5 models were  built  and  trained  using  real-time  ECG  rhythms  through various machine learning algorithms to test performance on the dataset  and  obtain  the  best  accuracy.  The  applied  algorithms were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Multi-layer Per-ceptron  (MLP),  Logistic  Regression  (LR),  Long-Short-TermMemory Network (LSTM), and Support Vector Classification(SVC)
